===================================== Scope =====================================

PROBLEMS
• Cognitive overload from long-form DSA video lectures (60+ minutes)
• Linear, passive nature of video content hinders active learning
• Difficulty in locating specific concepts or code examples within lengthy videos
• Lack of interactive elements in traditional video-based learning
• Students spending disproportionate time searching for explanations rather than learning
• No indexing or dynamic interaction with video content
• Inefficient knowledge retrieval for complex technical subjects
• Limited accessibility for students with different learning styles
• Absence of structured study materials from video content
• Difficulty in maintaining engagement during lengthy technical explanations

SOLUTION
• AI-powered video summarization specifically designed for DSA content
• Modular pipeline that processes videos from ingestion to interactive querying
• Automatic extraction of audio, frames, and transcription with timestamps
• Domain-specific content analysis identifying DSA topics, algorithms, and code examples
• Generation of structured summaries preserving logical flow and conceptual hierarchy
• Interactive chatbot interface for natural language queries about video content
• Local deployment ensuring data privacy and customization
• Streamlit-based frontend for intuitive user experience
• Vector database enabling semantic search and context-aware responses
• Support for both YouTube URLs and local video file uploads

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY
• Video Processing: YouTube-DL for video download, FFmpeg for audio/frame extraction
• Speech Recognition: OpenAI Whisper for high-accuracy transcription
• Computer Vision: Frame analysis for code and diagram detection
• Natural Language Processing: Domain-specific keyword extraction and topic identification
• Large Language Models: Local LLM (Gemini) for summarization and chatbot responses
• Vector Database: ChromaDB for semantic search and content retrieval
• Frontend: Streamlit for web-based user interface
• Programming Languages: Python for backend processing, JavaScript for frontend
• Data Formats: JSON for structured data storage, Markdown for summary generation
• Version Control: Git for code management and collaboration

ETHICS BY DESIGN
• Local deployment prevents data transmission to external servers
• No personal data storage or user tracking
• Transparent processing pipeline with explainable AI components
• Privacy-first approach with all processing occurring within user environment
• Bias mitigation through diverse training data and regular model audits
• Accessibility considerations for users with varying technical proficiency
• Clear limitations and scope boundaries to prevent misuse
• Educational focus rather than commercial exploitation
• Open-source architecture enabling community review and improvement
• Regular ethical audits and user feedback integration
• Compliance with educational data protection regulations (FERPA, GDPR)
• Human-in-the-loop mechanisms for critical content validation
• Emphasis on supplementing rather than replacing human instruction
